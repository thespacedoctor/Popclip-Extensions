# Popclip Extensions

![](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/images/Dictshot-en3.png)

[Popclip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) is a very useful macOS utility that takes the text you've selected and does 'stuff' to it, e.g. search your favourite website using the text as the query, or execute a script with the text as an input variable. You can [read more here](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/).

These are the some of the popclip extensions that I've built.
